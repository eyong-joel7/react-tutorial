 Hooks are a new feature in React that allows to use features without having to write a class
 for example; the state of a component could only be used inside a class component but with 
 hooks it is possible to use state in functional componanets as well
 One note is that Hooks dont work inside class components - this is obvious
 Reasons for Hooks
 - The this keyword is a pain in the ass for developers to understand
 - one needs to initialised methods inside the constructors 
 - No particular way to reuse stateful components though HOC and render props 
    address this  but you will need to restructure your component
- the is a need to share stateful logic in a better way - Hooks comes in handy
 - Realated code is not organized in one place
